*Created by Kyle Agronick <agronick@gmail.com>*

This was a fun little project I made a few years ago. I don't have the time right now to maintain it. If anyone wants to take it over I'd be happy to give them access.

Relay is an IRC client that attemps to be small, quick, easy to use, elegant, and functional. 
The Github and Launchpad repos are mirrored. You can find up-to-date information about Relay on Launchpad and Github.

If Relay displays with a light interface please open up an issue and let me know what displays when you type
`echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`. I will need to add some code to detect and load a suitable dark theme preloaded
in your distro.
